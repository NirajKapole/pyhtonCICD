# Hello World Python App Deployment with GitHub Actions

This guide will walk you through setting up a deployment pipeline for a simple "Hello, World!" Python application using GitHub Actions. The pipeline can automatically build and deploy your Python app when changes are pushed to a specific branch, such as `main`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following in place:

1. A GitHub repository where your Python application is stored.

2. A basic Python application that prints "Hello, World!"

3. (Optional) A Dockerfile if you want to containerize your Python application.

## Steps

Follow these steps to set up the deployment pipeline:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a GitHub repository for your Python application.
   - Push your Python code to this repository.

2. **Create a Basic Python Application**:
   - Ensure your Python application is stored in a directory, for example, "app.py," and it contains a simple "Hello World!" print statement.

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Create a folder named `.github/workflows` in your repository.
   - Inside this folder, create a YAML file (e.g., `deploy.yml`) to define your GitHub Actions workflow. You can use the provided sample `deploy.yml` in the previous response.
   - 
4. **Commit and Push**:
   - Commit the changes you made to the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file and push them to your GitHub repository.

GitHub Actions will now automatically build and deploy your Python "Hello, World!" app whenever you push changes to the specified branch (e.g., `main`). If you're using Docker, it will build a Docker image and run the container as specified in the YAML file.
